# Authentication

All API requests require authentication using an API key or bearer token. This guide explains how to authenticate your requests.

## API Keys

API keys are used to authenticate requests to the API. You can generate API keys from your dashboard.

### Using API Keys

Include your API key in the request header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  https://api.example.com/v1/users
```

### Security Best Practices

- **Never commit API keys to version control**
- **Rotate keys regularly**
- **Use environment variables** to store keys
- **Restrict key permissions** to only what's needed

## Bearer Tokens

For user-specific operations, you can use bearer tokens obtained through the login endpoint.

### Obtaining a Token

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.example.com/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "your_username",
    "password": "your_password"
  }'
```

The response will include a `token` field:

```json
{
  "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
}
```

### Using Bearer Tokens

Include the token in the Authorization header:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  https://api.example.com/v1/users
```

## Token Expiration

Bearer tokens expire after 24 hours. You'll need to refresh your token by logging in again when it expires.

## Error Responses

If authentication fails, you'll receive a `401 Unauthorized` response:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "unauthorized",
    "message": "Invalid or expired token"
  }
}
```
