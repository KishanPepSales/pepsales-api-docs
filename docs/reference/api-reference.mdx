## Getting Started

1. **Authenticate**: Start by obtaining an access token using the [`POST /auth/login`](./auth#post-authlogin) endpoint with your email and password
2. **Explore Endpoints**: Browse the endpoints below organized by category
3. **Try It Out**: Click "Try it out" on any endpoint to test it with your credentials
4. **View Examples**: See request/response examples for each endpoint

:::tip
All authenticated endpoints require a bearer token. Include it in the Authorization header:
```

```
:::

## Endpoints

The API is organized into the following categories:

- **Authentication** - User authentication and token management
