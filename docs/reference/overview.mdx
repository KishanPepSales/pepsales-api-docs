# API Overview

Welcome to the API Reference. This section provides detailed documentation for all available endpoints.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api1.pepsales.xyz
```

Note: The login endpoint is at `/auth/login` (without version prefix), while other endpoints like analyze_call use the `/v1/` prefix.

## API Versioning

The API is versioned using the URL path. The current version is **v1**.

When we release breaking changes, we'll introduce a new version (e.g., v2) while maintaining backward compatibility with previous versions.

## Request Format

All requests should include:

- **Content-Type**: `application/json`
- **Authorization**: `Bearer YOUR_TOKEN` (for authenticated endpoints)

## Response Format

All successful responses return JSON with the following structure:

```json
{
  "data": { ... },
  "meta": {
    "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

## Endpoints by Category

- [`POST /auth/login`](./auth) - Authenticate with email and password to receive an access token

### Analyze Call
